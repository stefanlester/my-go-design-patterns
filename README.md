# my-go-design-patterns

Implementation of go design patterns collected over time.

1. Single Responsility Principle :
-A type should only have one reason to change 
-Separation of concerns - different types/packages handling different, independent tasks/problems

2. Open-Closed Principle :
-Types should be open to substitute an embedding type in place of its embedded part
